# Quetiapine-Model
Pregnant PBPK model of antipsychotic quetiapine.

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of quetiapine for pregnant women. This work was conducted on a 27-compartment pregnancy model structure provided by Dallmann et al[1]. The detailed information on model development and evaluation was described in [2].
